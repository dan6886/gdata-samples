Welcome to The Chow Down!

 * To run locally, edit src/customsettings.py.default and follow the 
   instructions in that file.  
   
 * If you want to deploy, register a new App Engine site and change the 
   application setting in app.yaml to match the name that you registered.
   
 * The source code is documented, so poke through it to follow along.  If you
   want a better walkthrough, read:
